## DATA MANAGEMENT 
Creating standardized, comparable and open source workflow

## Project Data Life Cycle
* Data collection: sampling design, field work planning.
* Data Storage & Archival: keep data available beyond your own research project; how to ensure that data remain accessible and usable in the long term. The main goal of data preservation is to protect the data and information from being lost, or destroyed, and to contribute to the reuse of your data.
* Data processing: data exploration, data transformation, etc. Consider file formats and File Nomenclature Convention (FNC)
* Data sharing: once data has been processed and placed in the appropriate archive, it should be made available online
